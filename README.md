# Semeru
VCV Rack is an open-source software that simulates hardware modular synthesizers, used by musicians around the world. The Semeru plugin was created for my thesis to facilitate musicians to use Gamelan’s Pelog and Slendro scales in their musical compositions. It was implemented with C++, using VCV’s SDK. You can compile it with VCV SDK, or for ease of installation, I will post it to VCV Library soon.
